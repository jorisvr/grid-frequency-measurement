Measuring the frequency of the power grid
=========================================

This repository contains Arduino code and Python code that I used
to measure the frequency of the power grid.

Folder "v1" contains code that I used in 2010 for a short measurement.
Folder "v3" contains unfinished code that I plan to use for longer measurements.

For more information, see

NOTE: This is just a hobby project. The software in this repository is
unmaintained and is probably not useful in its current state.

Feel free to contact me with questions or remarks.
But I will probably not handle bug reports and pull requests.
